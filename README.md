SyncTwitterClient
=================
*SyncTwitterClient* is SIMBL plugin which sync timeline positions between *Twitter for Mac* and *Tweetbot for Mac*.
I tested on following:
- [Twitter for Mac 3.0.1 (3.0.1)](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12)
- [Tweetbot for Mac 1.4.1 (14100)](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12) with iCloud sync.
While running *Tweetbot for Mac*, *Twitter for Mac*'s timeline position will be synced with *Tweetbot for Mac, iPhone and iPad*.

**SyncTwitterClient does not support using TweetMarker on Tweetbot.**

How to install
--------------
1. Make sure you have installed SIMBL which supports sandbox. (e.g. [EasySIMBL](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL))
2. Download [SyncTwitterClient-0.3.zip](http://github.com/norio-nomura/SyncTwitterClient/releases/download/0.3/SyncTwitterClient-0.3.zip) (2014/01/27 updated)
3. Copy `SyncTwitterClient.bundle` to `~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins`.
   (If using EasySIMBL, double clicking the bundle will install it.)
4. Restart *Tweetbot for Mac* and *Twitter for Mac*.
